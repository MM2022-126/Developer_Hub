 Key Findings from the Nmap Output:
1. Port 9090 is Open
•	Confirmed your DVNA app is running.
•	It returns a 302 Redirect to /login, so authentication is required.
2. HTTP Headers Show Security Features
Your app is using Helmet, which is great. We can see it sets:
•	Content-Security-Policy
•	X-Frame-Options
•	X-Content-Type-Options
•	Strict-Transport-Security
•	And others…
These are good hardening measures. 
3. Session Cookie
Nmap captured this:
Set-Cookie: connect.sid=s%3A...
This shows a session is being created even on redirection. Useful for session management testing or hijacking if not secured properly.
4. Server Fingerprint Not Recognized
Nmap shows zeus-admin? because DVNA isn't a well-known service — but that’s fine for a custom app.
